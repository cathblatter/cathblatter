### Hi ğŸ‘‹

I'm wrangling all kinds of health services research data with R (by day) and any other data by night. 
I am particularly picky about writing safe code. I also like to improve my coding skills in general, currently: 

 - ğŸŒ± learning basics in CSS, HTML & JS 
 - ğŸ›  Iâ€™m always open to collaborate on R packages to dive into testing/writing unit tests  
 - ğŸ¤“ reading about Python & Julia
