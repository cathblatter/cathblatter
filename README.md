### Hi ğŸ‘‹

I'm wrangling all kinds of health services research data with R (by day) and any other data (eg. fitness tracker, household budget) by night. 
I am particularly picky about writing "safe" code. I also like to improve my coding skills in general, currently: 

 - ğŸŒ± learning basics in CSS and HTML 
 - ğŸ›  Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on R packages to dive into testing/writing unit tests
